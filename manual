OBJECTIVES
  
  Journey through the forest and try to survive while battling enemies in this text-based RPG game!

RULES
  
  For One player!
  Choose among 3 fierce classes: a Warrior, a Wizard, or an Archer.
  You choose your fate! Your choices have consequences, pick the correct choice or PERISH!

Install and enable the following:

    C/C++ by Microsoft C/C++ Extension Pack by Microsoft C/C++
    Themes by Microsoft CMake Tools by Microsoft
    YAML by Red Hat
    Better C++ Syntax by Jeff Hykin
    (AND make sure you are running the redhat compiler kit in your IDE)

The way to install this game is to download the files from the repository via .zip and in an IDE, run the commands:

    cmake .
    make
    Note: For certain cases, you may need to delete the CMake cache file in order for Make to run correctly (only if you get an error)

From there, you can open up any terminal that your computer has, and change directories so that you're in that downloaded folder. Run ./bin/finalProject and the game will be executed :)
